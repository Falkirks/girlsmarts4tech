# GIRLsmarts4tech 2018 Programming Activity

The girls will learn some programming basics and make a simple game in JavaScript in an hour.

## Learning Goals

By the end of the activity, girls should:

// Just a template for now

- Understand the purpose of programming

- Understand the concept of giving commands to a computer in a programming language

- Be able to make a simple game in JavaScript

- Understand the commands are executed in a certain order, and you can change that order using control commands

- Understand the concept of fixing a bug

- Be excited to try new things in JavaScript, or other languages

## Facilitation

### Technical Requirements

- We need computers to have a web browser installed with Internet access.

- We need access to [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/).

  The girls can have fork the starter and work from there. Each fork has a unique url address and they can just type that url and work from there after the workshop. If they do not want to create a fork everytime, they can get an account.

### Required Materials

- A room with a projector

- A room with one computer per student

- Printed materials? (TODO)

- Stickers for prizes?

### Volunteer Requirements

At least 3-4 people: 1 to present and others to answer the questions of the girls.

## Code Links

- Starter: https://codepen.io/42mandychen/pen/LjyJZa?editors=0010 (only a template now).

  The files are in this repo too: [index.html](./starter/index.html), and [canvas.js](./starter/canvas.js). The only difference is with Codepen, the JavaScript file link does not need to be linked whereas the html file in this repo is [linked to the js file](./starter/index.html#4).

- Completed: https://codepen.io/42mandychen/pen/rzmRqz?editors=0010 (only a template now).
