# GIRLsmarts4tech 2018 Programming Activity

This repo contains the lesson plan for GIRLsmarts4tech 2018 Programming Activity.

***The activity lesson plan is currently under development.***

## Activity File Guide

- [Activity Manual](./manual.md): activity manual for girls. It has instructions of how to access starter and completed files, the topics they learn during the workshop, and some external resources. It is intended for girls to read ***afterwards***.

- Code Links

  - Starter: `./starter`

    The files are in this repo too: [index.html](./starter/index.html), and [canvas.js](./starter/canvas.js). The only difference is with Codepen, the JavaScript file link does not need to be linked whereas the html file in this repo is [linked to the js file](./starter/index.html#L4).

  - Completed: `./completed`. Demo: https://ubc-cpsc.github.io/girlsmarts4tech/Programming/2018/completed/

- [Additional Information](./additional.md): some behind-the-scene information about this activity.
